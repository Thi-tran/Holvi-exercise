# RaceGame

From the exercise of Carlos, I decided to make the application as a game. 
- In Listing View, user will see the list of players from the table (hard-coded). When user click to the flag, their team info will show up in a Dialog. 
- In Standing View, user will see the current standing of players in and their points. There is interval every 1 second running in the background so the chart will automatically update, which gives you a real feeling of watching a real racing game. 
- When user click in a player from Standing View, the view for driver's information will show up with information about the driver and its team points. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server ( with Flask running in background). Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests Jasmine via [Karma] 

Enjoy racing!
